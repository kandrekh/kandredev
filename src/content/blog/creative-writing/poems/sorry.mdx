This poem explores the complexity and emotional depth behind the word “sorry,” portraying it as both a powerful symbol and an often-hollow gesture. It underscores how remorse alone cannot undo past harm or bring back what’s lost. Yet, it suggests that “sorry” might offer a path toward healing, forgiveness, and personal growth—if expressed with sincerity and action.

#### Sorry

The time of war is aging, <br/>
To feed the fire that is raging, <br/>
We will battle onward to the end. <br/>
Show our strength, our might, - no need to defend. <br/>

We will find the power to devour, <br/>
Our regrets, our sorrow, and remorse. <br/>
To live with the karma of our curse, <br/>
Let the diabolic forces and essence of human nature be wakened. <br/>

Drown the world in sorrow and dark, <br/>
Secure the legacy that won't depart. <br/>
Born in a world that must be torn apart, <br/>
We must survive! <br/>
In every culture, every life, <br/>
Sorry cannot replace what is lost, <br/>
The hurt, the pain, the cost. <br/>
We've endured the trials, the strife, <br/>
But sorry cannot bring back what was once alive. <br/>


Perhaps "sorry" is just a word, <br/>
A feeble attempt to be heard. <br/>
But in the end, it cannot mend, <br/>
The wounds we've caused, the lives we've spent. <br/>
But still, we say it, time and again, <br/>
A hollow promise, a fleeting trend. <br/>
But in the end, we must learn, <br/>
To face the truth, to take our turn. <br/>
We must learn to forgive, to let go, <br/>
To find the strength to rise and grow. <br/>

Perhaps "sorry" is just a start, <br/>
A way to show we have a heart. <br/>

Perhaps "sorry" is the modest attire, <br/>
A way to show we have the desire, <br/>
A cloak for demons we never retire, <br/>
Kindness and compassion, our only fire. <br/>
It is the word we all take for granted, <br/>
A simple gesture, a way to be candid. <br/>
A word often misused, a word often abused, <br/>
Sorry, the word we hate when used. <br/>
The expression of regret, sorrow, and remorse, <br/>
To right the wrongs, to change the course. <br/>
Of things we have caused,<br/>
The pain we have wrought, <br/>
To tame the evil in our hearts.<br/>
